			<h1>A Baked Potato Recipe</h1>
			<h2>by Amos Miller</h2>
			<blockquote>
				This is so simple, you'll laugh. It tastes so good, you'll cry. I make this when we are grilling for our guests and friends and they love it. You can also do this in your oven, any time.
				<br><br>  I know an eminent doctor of Chinese medicine who once told me that it was OK to eat a Big Mac once in a while. You're an adult, adjust things to suit your sensibilities: a butter substitute, light olive oil, bac-o-bits.
				<br><br>  No need to 'turn' the potato while it's roasting. You want the well-darkened skin on the bottom and the lovely 'melted' bacon sprawling on top... but no substitutes for me.

			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Idaho baking potatoes (as many as you have guests)</li>
				<li>butter (a pat or two)
				olive oil</li>
				<li>springs of fresh thyme (one for each potato)</li>
				<li>smoked bacon (one strip for every 2 potatoes</li>
				<li>sea salt & cracked black pepper</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Directions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Lay out 2 sheets of aluminum foil for each potato</li>
				<li>Wash the spuds</li>
				<li>cut the strip(s) of bacon in half</li>
				<li>rinse the thyme</li>
				<li>Carefully cut the potato lengthwise, but DO NOT cut all the way through, then, give your chef's knife a slight twist until you hear a faint 'crack', creating a hinge</li>
				<li>CAREFULLY: with a dinner fork, pierce the inside of each side of each potato 4 times horizontally, then 3-4 times vertically. This will give you a more tender inside and will 'permeate' the spud with the butter & thyme</li>
				<li>Place the potato on the double foil</li>
				<li>Cut thin slices of butter (or 1 long thin slice) and pry the potato open just enough to slip the butter between the halves</li>
				<li>Lay a sprig of thyme on the slit and, with the back of your knife, push the sprig between the halves, into the butter</li>
				<li>Rub any 'oozing' butter all over the skin, lube it up!</li>
				<li>Lay a half strip of bacon over the slit</li>
				<li>Drizzle olive oil over the potato</li>
				<li>Loosely fold the first sheet of foil over the potato and scrunch up the ends to cover</li>
				<li>Loosely fold the second sheet of foil over the first and fold to seal</li>
				<li>Place on the grill (or in a 350^ oven) for 1 hour</li>
