	Looking at the manifesto now, we see a lot of small things we don’t agree with.
		<ol>
			<li>First of all, we think the title should have been <em>“Non–representationism”</em> instead of <em>“Disrepresentationism”.</em>
		<li>Moreover, the categories of ‘representation’ and ‘dis–or non–representation’ are not really part of our thinking anymore.
		<li>We also used some other words in the manifesto (‘functionality’ and ‘amoralism’) that we would never use now;
		</ol>
in fact, looking back at our body of work, we think our work has been very moralistic, <strong>from the very start.</strong></p>
