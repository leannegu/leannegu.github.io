Moreover, the categories of <strong>‘representation’</strong> and <strong>‘dis–or non–representation’</strong> are not really part of our thinking anymore. We also used some other words in the manifesto (<strong>‘functionality’ and ‘amoralism’</strong>) that we would never use now; in fact, looking back at our body of work, we think our work has been very moralistic, from the very start. <strong>Looking at the manifesto now, we see a lot of small things we don’t agree with.</strong> First of all, we think the title should have been <em>“Non–representationism”</em> instead of <strong>“Disrepresentationism”</strong>.
