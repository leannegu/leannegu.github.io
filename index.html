While it has been a major driving force in creating a unified global community, it has also provided us with a constant distraction. Why is it that we can’t seem to stop clicking, get offline and escape the online noise? What is so tempting about social media, clickbait and memes? Can you avoid succumbing to the distractions of the 21st century and get through this entire article? You better get reading now, time's ticking.

  Excerpt from <em>'Statistically, you’re only going to read 28 percent of this'</em> - by Simon Hill <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/internet-age-attention-spans-experts-weigh-in/">(&#8617;)</a>
      </div>
    </span> Are you reading this? And if you read that sentence, are you going to read the next one? If you didn’t leave this story after a few seconds, maybe we can keep you. We know that <span class="dummylink">the Internet</span> is changing how we interact with information, but it’s often accused of destroying our <span class="dummylink">attention spans</span>. Is it true?
      <p>“On a functional level people have a much higher degree of <span class="dummylink">distractibility</span>, when it comes to digital technology,” explains Dr. David Greenfield, founder of the <span class="dummylink">Center for Internet and Technology Addiction</span> and Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the <span class="dummylink">University of Connecticut School of Medicine</span>. “Whether those effects lead to long-lasting neurobiological changes we don’t know yet.”</p>

      <span class="chapter"> 1.1</span><span class="subheading"> Where’s the evidence?</span>
      <p>The problem with theories of <span class="dummylink">tech distraction</span> is that there isn’t a great deal of evidence to back it up yet. One study commissioned by the British bank <span class="dummylink">Lloyds TSB</span> a few years back suggested the average attention span had fallen from 12 minutes in 1998 down to 5 minutes in 2008, but it was based on a survey of 1,000 people and didn’t specify what kind of attention it was talking about. Apparently the researchers got too distracted to think through their work.</p>
      <p>17 percent of page views last less than 4 seconds, and only 4 percent go beyond 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>We can find some more useful statistics if we look to the Internet. <span class="dummylink">Statistic Brain</span>, citing the study <span class="dummylink">Not Quite the Average: An Empirical Study of Web Use</span>, believes the average attention span dropped to 8 seconds in 2013 compared to 12 seconds in 2000. Internet browsing habits observed in the study revealed that 17 percent of page views last less than 4 seconds, and only 4 percent go beyond 10 minutes. The study also found that on average we read 28 percent of the 593 words on an average Web page.</p>
      <p>Teachers certainly believe there has been an impact. <span class="dummylink">A Common Sense Media study</span> found that 71 percent of teachers believe students’ entertainment media use (<span class="dummylink">TV</span>, <span class="dummylink">video games</span>, <span class="dummylink">texting</span>, and <span class="dummylink">social networking</span>) has hurt their attention spans at least “somewhat.”
      “Some say [Internet use] can actually enhance attention, but the enhancement is typically only relevant while you’re using it,” explained Dr. Greenfield. “When you turn the screen off and try to do things in real life, people can struggle with attention because they’re always being <span class="dummylink">bombarded by stimuli and notifications</span> that pull them away from the moment.”</p>
      <p>It’s early days from a <span class="dummylink">medical data</span> point of view, too. “We really don’t have that many years of data,” says Dr. Greenfield, “It’s only over the next 10 to 15 years that we’re going to start seeing what kind of long term deleterious effects may come from chronic long-term digital media use.”</p>
      <span class="chapter"> 1.1</span><span class="subheading"> Is Googling replacing research?</span>
      <p>According to <span class="dummylink">Pew Research</span>, 94 percent of the middle and high-school teachers surveyed suggested that students were very likely to use <span class="dummylink">Google</span> for research, and 75 percent would refer to <span class="dummylink">Wikipedia</span>. Textbooks scored just 18 percent and local libraries a bleak 16 percent.</p>
      <p>What’s wrong with that, you may ask? Well, <span class="dummylink">Dr. Ziming Liu</span> of San Jose University wrote a paper on reading behavior in the digital environment and found that people tend to browse, scan, and skim more when they read online. They aren’t stopping to analyze or understand what they’re reading.</p>
      <p>“Think about the way digital information is conveyed, as short bits of information,” said Dr. Greenfield. “The idea of working on something in-depth over a long period of time is falling out of favor, because people are Googling, reading the first sentence of whatever comes up and then they’re done. People are using the Internet this way because most of the time they find what they want. When you find what you want you get a slight hit in your <span class="dummylink">pleasure neurotransmitter</span> because you’re getting satisfied, and as long as you get that hit you’re going to be more likely to keep doing it. We’re reinforced by that positive experience.”</p>
      <p>“A concern that we have,” said Dr. Greenfield, “is that if you’re not using some of these deeper capacities for thinking, because you’re using a digital device as a section of your brain, then those skill-sets will atrophy.”</p>
      <span class="chapter"> 1.3</span><span class="subheading"> You’re doing it wrong</span>
      <p>There have been various studies showing that <span class="dummylink">multitasking</span> slows us down. It’s a case Professor Nass at Stanford University makes succinctly in <span class="dummylink">The Myth of Multitasking</span> on NPR. “People who multitask all the time can’t filter out irrelevancy. They can’t manage a working memory. They’re chronically distracted.”</p>
      <p>Constantly vetting information is distracting and it requires your attention to filter the incoming noise.</p>
      <p>“When you find what you want you get a slight hit in your pleasure neurotransmitter because you’re getting satisfied.”
      When Dr. Greenfield talks about the <span class="dummylink">smartphone</span> he points out that “in some ways we’ve become <span class="dummylink">Pavlovian dogs</span>.” That incoming message alert triggers a strong impulse in us to check our smartphones. We’re excited at the possibility it may be something interesting, though it rarely is.</p>
      <p>“One thing we do know about attentional capacity is that we have a limited bandwidth. If you take away from one end you’re going to lose it on the other,” Dr. Greenfield explains, “That’s why smartphones and driving are so deadly, because any attention you take away from the complex cognitive process reduces your ability to drive safely and effectively.”</p>
      <span class="chapter"> 1.4</span><span class="subheading"> What can we do?</span>
      <p>If you’re concerned about the impact the Internet is having on your attention span, it’s easy to do something about it.
      <p>“The first thing you can do about it is turn off <span class="dummylink">notifications</span>, so your attention is not being pulled to the device all the time,” says Dr. Greenfield. “The next step is to turn it off and just check it when you need it. Don’t keep it on all the time, just check it at certain intervals throughout the day. With the exception of a few professions, most of us do not need to be contactable all the time.”</p>
      <p>It may be a few years before we know the full impact of the digital world on our brains, but few would argue about the merits of tuning out digital distractions from time to time. We don’t have to give up the Internet or throw our smartphones away, but we’ll benefit from mixing it up with a <span class="dummylink">book</span> or <span class="dummylink">taking a walk on the beach</span>.</p>
      <p>And if you read this far, pat yourself on the back. You may not have a problem at all.</p>

        Excerpt from <em>'The Internet With A Human Face'
      </em> - by Maciej Cegłowski <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/internet_with_a_human_face.htm">(&#8617;)</a>
    </div>
  </span> Before the Internet, advertisers lived in the <span class="dummylink">Dark Ages</span>. If you wanted to run an ad campaign, you went to <span class="dummylink">Don Draper</span>. Draper would sip his whiskey and tell you what your next <span class="dummylink">ad campaign</span> would look like. "We're going to say that smoking keeps you skinny. Bottoms up, gentlemen!" And that was it. The next quarter you looked at your sales figures. If they were up, that meant the ad campaign had succeeded.</p>
<p>The Internet was Christmas for advertisers. Suddenly you could know exactly who was looking at your ads, and you could target them by <span class="dummylink">age</span>, <span class="dummylink">sex</span>, <span class="dummylink">income</span>, <span class="dummylink">location</span>, almost any criterion you wanted.
One of the first <span class="dummylink">banner ads</span> had a click-through rate of 78%. That's mind-boggling. Do you know what two words were on that banner ad? "Shop Naked!" CLICK! But banner ads turned out to be like poison ivy. People clicked them once, and learned never to touch them again. The industry collapsed in a flurry of pop-overs, pop-unders, and shame. Until Google discovered you could serve little text ads in context, and people would click on them. The whole industry climbed on this life raft, and remains there to this day. Advertising, or the promise of advertising, is the economic foundation of the world wide web.</p>
<p>Advertising we all know. Someone pays you to convince your users that they'll be happy if they buy a product or service. Advertising is really lucrative if you run your own ad network. That's like running a casino. You can't help but make money.</p>
<p>If you don't run your own ad network, advertising is a scary business. You bring your <span class="dummylink">user data</span> to the altar and sacrifice it to AdSense. If the AdSense gods are pleased, they rain earnings down upon you.</p>
<p>But if the AdSense gods are angry, there is wailing, and gnashing of teeth. You rend your garments and ask forgiveness, but you can never be sure what you did wrong. Maybe you pray to <span class="dummylink">Matt Cutts</span>, the intercessionary saint at Google, who has been known to descend from the clouds and speak with a human voice.</p>
<p>And your users, of course, HATE advertising. So to keep revenue from falling, you're stuck in an arms race where you have to keep changing up your approach.</p>
<p>Right now, the frontier of advertising is in <span class="dummylink">mobile apps</span>. Next year it will be something else.</p>
Maybe some of you have seen these things popping up recently; paid ads that pretend to be related links. In another few weeks, people will learn to tune them out, and a different plague of ads will descend on us.</p>
<p>Advertising is like the flu. If it's not constantly changing, people develop immunity.</p>
<p>Consider your own experience of <span class="dummylink">targeted ads</span>. Spend half an hour on the Internet with ad blocking turned off, if you dare. These "targeted" ads just don't target very well. They work on the same principle as <span class="dummylink">spam</span>: throw enough of this shit at a user, and someone is going to click.</p>
<p>And it comes at such a steep price.</p>
<p>Of course, for ad sellers, the crappiness of targeted ads is a feature! It means there's vast room for improvement. So many stories to tell the investors.</p>
<p>This ghost of a business model propels us to ever greater extremes of <span class="dummylink">surveillance</span>. If the algorithms don't work, that's a sign we need more data. If the algorithms do work, then imagine how much better they'll work with more <span class="dummylink">data</span>. There's only one outcome allowed: collect more data.</p>
<p>I don't oppose advertising. I think ads have an important role to play. But advertising, and stories about advertising, can't carry the weight of our entire industry.</p>

</span> “Silence is a commons,” wrote social critic <span class="dummylink">Ivan Illich</span>. He argued that just as the communal pastures were privatised in the 18th century, so now the collective sense of calm is being <span class="dummylink">invaded by technology</span>. He was thinking of loudspeakers, computers and electronic gadgets, which he lumped together in a single category: “<span class="dummylink">the machines</span>”. This was in the 1980s, before <span class="dummylink">email</span>, <span class="dummylink">mobile phones</span>, <span class="dummylink">texting</span> and the infinite stream of <span class="dummylink">social media</span>. One can only imagine what he would have made of this daily communication firebombing. But the battered and shrivelled human attention span, if not quite a commons, would certainly have appeared to Illich as a victim of noise.</p>

  </em> - by Geert Lovink <a href="http://www.e-flux.com/journal/75/67166/on-the-social-media-ideology/">(&#8617;)</a></div>
</span> Like <span class="dummylink">Edward Snowden’s</span> revelations, <span class="dummylink">Sherry Turkle’s</span> evidence about smartphones inhibiting one’s empathy and ability to enjoy the virtues of solitude have arrived late in the social media game. How hard has it become to confront <span class="dummylink">offline boredom</span>? It’s a straight-up torture.
The slogan “You are what you share” (<span class="dummylink">Charles Leadbeater</span>) expresses the transformation of the autonomous unit of the self into an outgoing entity that is constantly reproducing its social capital through the transmission of value (data) to others. Let’s face it: we refuse to perceive ourselves as “<span class="dummylink">slaves of the machine</span>.” What does it mean when we all agree that there is an <span class="dummylink">addictive</span> element to today’s social media use, yet none of us is apparently addicted? Are we really returning only sporadically? What exactly is being captured here? If anything, we’re encapsulated by the social sphere as such, not by the software, nor by the protocols, network architectures, or the assuredly infantile interfaces.</p>
<p>Under this spell of desire for the social, led by the views and opinions of our immediate social circle, our daily routines are as follows: view recent stories first, fine-tune filter preferences, jump to first unread, update your life with events, clear and refresh all, not now, save links to read for later, see full conversation, mute your ex, set up a secret board, run a poll, comment through the social plug-in, add video to your profile, choose between love, haha, wow, sad, and angry, engage with those who mention you while tracking the changes in relationship status of others, follow a key opinion leader, receive notifications, create a photo spread that links to your avatar, repost a photo, get lost in the double-barrel river of your timeline, prevent friends from seeing updates, check out something based on a recommendation, customize cover images, create “must-click” headlines, chat with a friend while noticing that “1,326,595 people like this topic.”</p>

  <div class="footnote footnote__five">Excerpt from <em>'Psychology of Clickbait'
  </em> - by Bryan Gardiner <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/12/psychology-of-clickbait/">(&#8617;)</a></div>
</span> This section of the article will not restore your faith in humanity. Nor will it amaze, stun, delight, shock, charm, or in any literal or figurative way, blow your mind. What it will do — hopefully in a clear and intelligent way — is explain why people continually fall for <span class="dummylink">clickbait</span>.</p>
<p>Here’s what most people can agree on: Clickbait is annoying, but by god, it works—even when readers recognize it for what it is. The word’s substantial semantic drift may be behind some of this effectiveness. But a hefty helping of <span class="dummylink">behavioral science</span> is at play, too. As a number of new studies confirm, you can blame your clickbait habit on two things: the outsized role emotion plays in your intuitive judgements and daily choices, and your <span class="dummylink">lazy brain</span>.</p>
<span class="chapter"> 5.1</span><span class="subheading"> Manufacturing Emotion</span>
<p>Clickbait doesn’t just happen on its own. Editors write headlines in an effort to manipulate you — or at least grab your attention — and always have. The difference with clickbait is you’re often aware of this manipulation, and yet helpless to resist it. It’s at once obvious in its bait-iness, and somehow still effective bait.</p>
<span class="chapter"> 5.2</span><span class="subheading"> Mind the Curiosity Gap</span>
<p>Promising a hilarious or mind-blowing experience using hyperbole and superlatives (even when the subject clearly doesn’t warrant such language) is one way to attract clicks. Another is to provoke curiosity. <span class="dummylink">Upworthy</span> articles are particularly good at this and psychologists have a few theories why.</p>
<p>One of the more popular and enduring ones comes from Carnegie Mellon’s <span class="dummylink">George Loewenstein</span>. In the mid-1990s, Loewenstein came up with what he called the <span class="dummylink">“information-gap” theory</span>. It basically holds that whenever we perceive a gap “between what we know and what we want to know,” that gap has emotional consequences. “Such information gaps produce the feeling of deprivation labeled curiosity,” he wrote. “The curious individual is motivated to obtain the missing information to reduce or eliminate the feeling of deprivation.”</p>
<p>In other words, not knowing is cognitively uncomfortable.</p> <p>Historically, this is the thinking behind Upworthy-style “what happens next” headlines: “<span class="dummylink">Someone Gave Some Kids Some Scissors. Here’s What Happened Next</span>” or “<span class="dummylink">These Workers Just Want Money, And You Won’t Believe What They Did To Get Some.</span>” You can make people even more curious, say social psychologists, by presenting them with something they know a little bit about, but not too much.</p>
<span class="chapter"> 5.3</span><span class="subheading"> Anticipation Is Making You Click</span>
<p>So clickbait employs a number of effective cognitive tricks to get clicks. Fine. But even if readers rely on emotion and cognitive ease when choosing headlines, that still doesn’t explain why clickbait continues to work. Fool-me-once logic should mean that their effectiveness goes down as exposure goes up. How many cheap emotional ploys, false promises, and empty <span class="dummylink">listicles</span> and quizzes can a person endure? A lot, it turns out.</p>
<p>Research has shown that humans are quite willing to put up with massive amounts of disappointment and frustration so long as there’s an occasional payout that occurs in the form of <span class="dummylink">dopamine release</span>. And yes, sometimes clickbait does deliver these payouts … in spectacular fashion.</p>
<p>Now obviously not all clickbait can — or even attempts to — manipulate our dopamine levels. But given its involvement in emotional arousal, it’s fair to say it does factor. This complicates the overpromise/underdeliver argument many people use to predict clickbait’s waning effectiveness. Indeed, on a rational level you may know that the adorable puppy in <span class="dummylink">this Clickhole video</span> is right: you’ll still feel alone no matter how many videos you watch or how many lists you read. But behavioral science also suggests that reading about <span class="dummylink">the 25 most awkward cat sleeping positions</span> can also be an effective, if ever so brief, antidote to your existential isolation.</p>
