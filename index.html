  <div class="intro">
This collection of curated texts explores the ways in which the Internet has transformed how we interact with others. While it has been a major driving force in creating a unified global community, it has also provided us with a constant distraction. Why is it that we can’t seem to stop clicking, get offline and escape the online noise? What is so tempting about social media, clickbait and memes? Can you avoid succumbing to the distractions of the 21st century and get through this entire article? You better get reading now, time's ticking.

  Excerpt from <em>'Statistically, you’re only going to read 28 percent of this'</em> - by Simon Hill <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/internet-age-attention-spans-experts-weigh-in/">(link)</a>
      </div>
    </span> Are you reading this? And if you read that sentence, are you going to read the next one? If you didn’t leave this story after a few seconds, maybe we can keep you. We know that <span class="dummylink">the Internet</span> is changing how we interact with information, but it’s often accused of destroying our <span class="dummylink">attention spans</span>. Is it true?
      <p>“On a functional level people have a much higher degree of <span class="dummylink">distractibility</span>, when it comes to digital technology,” explains Dr. David Greenfield, founder of the <span class="dummylink">Center for Internet and Technology Addiction</span> and Assistant Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at the <span class="dummylink">University of Connecticut School of Medicine</span>. “Whether those effects lead to long-lasting neurobiological changes we don’t know yet.”</p>

      <span class="chapter"> 1.1</span><span class="subheading"> Where’s the evidence?</span>
      <p>The problem with theories of <span class="dummylink">tech distraction</span> is that there isn’t a great deal of evidence to back it up yet. One study commissioned by the British bank <span class="dummylink">Lloyds TSB</span> a few years back suggested the average attention span had fallen from 12 minutes in 1998 down to 5 minutes in 2008, but it was based on a survey of 1,000 people and didn’t specify what kind of attention it was talking about. Apparently the researchers got too distracted to think through their work.</p>
      <p>17 percent of page views last less than 4 seconds, and only 4 percent go beyond 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>We can find some more useful statistics if we look to the Internet. <span class="dummylink">Statistic Brain</span>, citing the study <span class="dummylink">Not Quite the Average: An Empirical Study of Web Use</span>, believes the average attention span dropped to 8 seconds in 2013 compared to 12 seconds in 2000. Internet browsing habits observed in the study revealed that 17 percent of page views last less than 4 seconds, and only 4 percent go beyond 10 minutes. The study also found that on average we read 28 percent of the 593 words on an average Web page.</p>
      <p>Teachers certainly believe there has been an impact. <span class="dummylink">A Common Sense Media study</span> found that 71 percent of teachers believe students’ entertainment media use (<span class="dummylink">TV</span>, <span class="dummylink">video games</span>, <span class="dummylink">texting</span>, and <span class="dummylink">social networking</span>) has hurt their attention spans at least “somewhat.”
      “Some say [Internet use] can actually enhance attention, but the enhancement is typically only relevant while you’re using it,” explained Dr. Greenfield. “When you turn the screen off and try to do things in real life, people can struggle with attention because they’re always being <span class="dummylink">bombarded by stimuli and notifications</span> that pull them away from the moment.”</p>
      <p>It’s early days from a <span class="dummylink">medical data</span> point of view, too. “We really don’t have that many years of data,” says Dr. Greenfield, “It’s only over the next 10 to 15 years that we’re going to start seeing what kind of long term deleterious effects may come from chronic long-term digital media use.”</p>
      <span class="chapter"> 1.1</span><span class="subheading"> Is Googling replacing research?</span>
      <p>According to Pew Research, 94 percent of the middle and high-school teachers surveyed suggested that students were very likely to use Google for research, and 75 percent would refer to Wikipedia. Textbooks scored just 18 percent and local libraries a bleak 16 percent.</p>
      <p>What’s wrong with that, you may ask? Well, Dr. Ziming Liu of San Jose University wrote a paper on reading behavior in the digital environment and found that people tend to browse, scan, and skim more when they read online. They aren’t stopping to analyze or understand what they’re reading.</p>

      <p>“Think about the way digital information is conveyed, as short bits of information,” said Dr. Greenfield. “The idea of working on something in-depth over a long period of time is falling out of favor, because people are Googling, reading the first sentence of whatever comes up and then they’re done. People are using the Internet this way because most of the time they find what they want. When you find what you want you get a slight hit in your pleasure neurotransmitter because you’re getting satisfied, and as long as you get that hit you’re going to be more likely to keep doing it. We’re reinforced by that positive experience.”</p>
      <p>“A concern that we have,” said Dr. Greenfield, “is that if you’re not using some of these deeper capacities for thinking, because you’re using a digital device as a section of your brain, then those skill-sets will atrophy.”</p>
      <span class="chapter"> 1.3</span><span class="subheading"> You’re doing it wrong</span>
      <p>There have been various studies showing that multitasking slows us down. It’s a case Professor Nass at Stanford University makes succinctly in The Myth of Multitasking on NPR. “People who multitask all the time can’t filter out irrelevancy. They can’t manage a working memory. They’re chronically distracted.”</p>
      <p>Constantly vetting information is distracting and it requires your attention to filter the incoming noise.</p>
      <p>“When you find what you want you get a slight hit in your pleasure neurotransmitter because you’re getting satisfied.”
      When Dr. Greenfield talks about the smartphone he points out that “in some ways we’ve become Pavlovian dogs.” That incoming message alert triggers a strong impulse in us to check our smartphones. We’re excited at the possibility it may be something interesting, though it rarely is.</p>
      <p>“One thing we do know about attentional capacity is that we have a limited bandwidth. If you take away from one end you’re going to lose it on the other,” Dr. Greenfield explains, “That’s why smartphones and driving are so deadly, because any attention you take away from the complex cognitive process reduces your ability to drive safely and effectively.”</p>
      <span class="chapter"> 1.4</span><span class="subheading"> What can we do?</span>
      <p>If you’re concerned about the impact the Internet is having on your attention span, it’s easy to do something about it.
      <p>“The first thing you can do about it is turn off notifications, so your attention is not being pulled to the device all the time,” says Dr. Greenfield. “The next step is to turn it off and just check it when you need it. Don’t keep it on all the time, just check it at certain intervals throughout the day. With the exception of a few professions, most of us do not need to be contactable all the time.”</p>
      <p>It may be a few years before we know the full impact of the digital world on our brains, but few would argue about the merits of tuning out digital distractions from time to time. We don’t have to give up the Internet or throw our smartphones away, but we’ll benefit from mixing it up with a book or taking a walk on the beach.</p>
      <p>And if you read this far, pat yourself on the back. You may not have a problem at all.</p>

        Excerpt from <em>'The Internet With A Human Face'
      </em> - by Maciej Cegłowski <a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/internet_with_a_human_face.htm">(link)</a>
    </div>
  </span> Before the Internet, advertisers lived in the Dark Ages. If you wanted to run an ad campaign, you went to Don Draper. Draper would sip his whiskey and tell you what your next ad campaign would look like. "We're going to say that smoking keeps you skinny. Bottoms up, gentlemen!" And that was it. The next quarter you looked at your sales figures. If they were up, that meant the ad campaign had succeeded.</p>
<p>The Internet was Christmas for advertisers. Suddenly you could know exactly who was looking at your ads, and you could target them by age, sex, income, location, almost any criterion you wanted.
One of the first banner ads had a click-through rate of 78%. That's mind-boggling. Do you know what two words were on that banner ad? "Shop Naked!" CLICK! But banner ads turned out to be like poison ivy. People clicked them once, and learned never to touch them again. The industry collapsed in a flurry of pop-overs, pop-unders, and shame. Until Google discovered you could serve little text ads in context, and people would click on them. The whole industry climbed on this life raft, and remains there to this day. Advertising, or the promise of advertising, is the economic foundation of the world wide web.</p>
<p>Advertising we all know. Someone pays you to convince your users that they'll be happy if they buy a product or service. Advertising is really lucrative if you run your own ad network. That's like running a casino. You can't help but make money.</p>
<p>If you don't run your own ad network, advertising is a scary business. You bring your user data to the altar and sacrifice it to AdSense. If the AdSense gods are pleased, they rain earnings down upon you.</p>
<p>But if the AdSense gods are angry, there is wailing, and gnashing of teeth. You rend your garments and ask forgiveness, but you can never be sure what you did wrong. Maybe you pray to Matt Cutts, the intercessionary saint at Google, who has been known to descend from the clouds and speak with a human voice.</p>
<p>And your users, of course, HATE advertising. So to keep revenue from falling, you're stuck in an arms race where you have to keep changing up your approach.</p>
<p>Right now, the frontier of advertising is in mobile apps. Next year it will be something else.</p>
Maybe some of you have seen these things popping up recently; paid ads that pretend to be related links. In another few weeks, people will learn to tune them out, and a different plague of ads will descend on us.</p>
<p>Advertising is like the flu. If it's not constantly changing, people develop immunity.</p>
<p>Consider your own experience of targeted ads. Spend half an hour on the Internet with ad blocking turned off, if you dare. These "targeted" ads just don't target very well. They work on the same principle as spam: throw enough of this shit at a user, and someone is going to click.</p>
<p>And it comes at such a steep price.</p>
<p>Of course, for ad sellers, the crappiness of targeted ads is a feature! It means there's vast room for improvement. So many stories to tell the investors.</p>
<p>This ghost of a business model propels us to ever greater extremes of surveillance. If the algorithms don't work, that's a sign we need more data. If the algorithms do work, then imagine how much better they'll work with more data. There's only one outcome allowed: collect more data.</p>
<p>I don't oppose advertising. I think ads have an important role to play. But advertising, and stories about advertising, can't carry the weight of our entire industry.</p>

  <div class="footnote footnote__three">Excerpt from <em>'The internet of broken things'
  </em> - by Justin McGuirk <a href="http://justinmcguirk.com/internet-broken-things">(link)</a></div>
</span> “Silence is a commons,” wrote social critic Ivan Illich. He argued that just as the communal pastures were privatised in the 18th century, so now the collective sense of calm is being invaded by technology. He was thinking of loudspeakers, computers and electronic gadgets, which he lumped together in a single category: “the machines”. This was in the 1980s, before email, mobile phones, texting and the infinite stream of social media. One can only imagine what he would have made of this daily communication firebombing. But the battered and shrivelled human attention span, if not quite a commons, would certainly have appeared to Illich as a victim of noise.</p>
